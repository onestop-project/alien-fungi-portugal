# Checklist of Alien Fungi in Portugal

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to standardize the data of the Checklist of Alien Fungi in Portugal to a [Darwin Core Archive](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) that can be harvested by [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/).

## Workflow

[source data](data/raw) → Darwin Core [mapping script](src/dwc_mapping.Rmd) → generated [Darwin Core files](data/processed)

## Published dataset

* [Dataset on the IPT](<!-- Add the URL of the dataset on the IPT here -->)
* [Dataset on GBIF](<!-- Add the DOI of the dataset on GBIF here -->)

## Repo structure

The repository structure is based on [Cookiecutter Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) and the [Checklist recipe](https://github.com/trias-project/checklist-recipe). Files and directories indicated with `GENERATED` should not be edited manually.

## License

<!-- The license is the open source license for the code and documentation in this repository, not the checklist data (that you can define in dwc_mapping.Rmd). As your repository is based on https://github.com/trias-project/checklist-recipe, we'd like it if you kept the open and permissive MIT license.
